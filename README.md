# Algorithm Python

This project is part of the Trybe Web Development course and consists of a collection of algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm addresses a specific problem and provides a solution written in the Python language.

## Objective

The objective behind this project was to consolidate the learnings in Python, and mainly to exercise the concepts learned in the study of **Algorithms**, such as Algorithmic Complexity, Recursion, and Sorting and Searching Algorithms.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, one containing the algorithms and another containing the `encrypt` algorithm tests (in this case, I didn't need to create the algorithm itself, the project requirement was to perform its tests). The directory structure is as follows:

```
├── challenges
│ ├── challenge_anagrams.py
│ ├── challenge_encrypt.py
│ └── challenge_find_the_duplicate.py
│ ├── challenge_palindromes_iterative.py
│ ├── challenge_palindromes_recursive.py
│ └── challenge_study_schedule.py
├── tests
│ ├── test_encrypt.py
│ ├── fibonacci.py
│ └── prime_numbers.py
```

## How to Use

After cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, and installing the dependencies, navigate to the `challenges` directory and run one of the files.

For example, to execute the algorithm (`challenge_anagrams.py`), you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 challenge_anagrams.py
```
